##This is a starting point for my projects.

##Why after.js:
- It seems to be the least opinitiated SSR framework out there. Its codebase is also easier to grok to spinning my own solution or forking it if needed should be easier to do.
- Best of both worlds, work in peace without worrying about webpack and when needed, fork it and monkey around or spin your own webpack setup.

**Typescript is not being used in strict mode as too much of it seemed to hold back development.**
